Since we (Evan and Matt) were heading to the inaugural New York Tech Zine Fair to volunteer along with a group of Olin students, we wanted to contribute to the "zine scene" as a way of communicating and documenting our project. Although our work has encompassed a number of different sub-projects, we chose to focus on conveying the things we learned throughout the process of building our low-power analog broadcast system. Over the course of a week, we created *Hyperlocal TV: A Primer on Analog Broadcast.*

We produced ~100 copies in two runs, half of which we gave away at the NYTZF and half of which we made for Expo, our end-of-the-semester demo of our work.
