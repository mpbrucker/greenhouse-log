**_The WGBH Media Library and Archives (MLA) ensures the long-term preservation and access to WGBHâ€™s vast archive of programming and original materials, which are made available through our Open Vault. With the Library of Congress, MLA stewards the American Archive of Public Broadcasting, an unprecedented initiative to preserve and make accessible historical content created by public media across the United States._**

Now, in collaboration with Olin College, the Archives are brought to life in a form that uses "new" tech to broadcast archival content in its original display format. THis is amazing.

Our low-power broadcast system allows classic content to be broadcast to vintage, analog television sets, giving a warm, nostalgic aesthetic to visual media from past decades. This installation serves to:

 * __Highlight the rich history of broadcast by institutions in the Boston area:__ The WGBH Archives have preserved decades of footage from WGBH, Cambridge Community TV, and other local broadcast stations. *Archives Over the Air* will not only show the public that the Archives exist, but it will also highlight various Boston area-produced programs and segments, connecting them to various historical events and contexts in both Boston and in public broadcasting as a whole.
 * __Display media in its original context:__ By transmitting over analog airwaves to vintage TV sets, our installation recreates one component of television watching as a cultural phenomenon. Vintage TV sets have an aesthetic that is inherently warm, tactile, and inviting, providing an opportunity for intergenerational connection as younger generations experience a new form of interaction.

### Where We've Been

In October 2018, we setup our Archives Over the Air installation at the WGBH Alumni Reunion event as a way of testing our technical setup. Footage from the event, with our setup in action, is shown below.

### The Installation

The Archives Over the Air installation is an interactive electronic exhibit, highlighting both content and physical interaction with vintage television sets. Visitors can view the broadcast content and interact by changing the channel or adjusting the antenna, replicating the original experience of watching television.

**Broadcast:** A single, central broadcast "tower," is capable of displaying digial media on up to six channels at once. A passive antenna provides a signal range of ~20 feet.

**Reception:** The signal can be received by any television set in range that is capable of receiving an analog signal, with no limitation on the number of sets. Currently, we have two television sets:
