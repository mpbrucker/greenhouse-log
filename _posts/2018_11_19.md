Working together, Olin Students have brought to life a corner of the WGBH archive in their original form.

We've designed and built a low-power broadcast system to transmit classic content to vintage, analog television sets over the air. This provides a novel, warm, authentic means to consume historic media from history. *Archives Over the Air* serves to:

 * __Highlight the rich history of broadcast by institutions in the Boston area__ 
 * __Create an interactive, inter-generational touchpoint for families__
 * __Illustrate the character of the technology from yesterday and today__ 
 * __Create custom content that plays with the unique characteristics of the medium__
