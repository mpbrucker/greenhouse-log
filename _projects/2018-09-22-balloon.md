## Prototype 0.5: The Balloon

*A live broadcast with a different perspective*

As a proof-of-concept for both our broadcast setup and our exhibit design, we set out to run our broadcaster with an unconventional input: a live, bird's-eye view of the "O," the center of Olin's campus.

### Origins

It started with the balloon. We started with Public Lab's [balloon mapping](https://store.publiclab.org/collections/mapping-kits/products/balloon-mapping-kit?variant=7028822724) kit, with the intent to use it for live broadcasting of a bird's-eye view. Once we'd developed a proof-of-concept for our analog broadcast setup, we decided to combine them in a live demo that tested both our broadcasting chops and our ability to create a compelling exhibit.

#### Livestreaming

We used a GoPro Hero 5, with a clip mount attached to a string that was tied around the balloon's loop. A mini battery pack, zip-tied to the camera, provided enough charge to broadcast for the time period that we needed. With a laptop connected to the GoPro's built-in wifi, a fork of this livestreaming script provided an easy way to start/stop streaming and recording.

### On the Air

At Olin's Alumni Weekend event, we deployed. With the help of a half-dozen other Oliners, we were able to successfully inflate, deploy, and setup our entire system. For a few hours, we broadcast and recorded GoPro footage of the O.
