**_The WGBH Media Library and Archives (MLA) ensures the long-term preservation and access to WGBHâ€™s vast archive of programming and original materials, which are made available through our Open Vault. With the Library of Congress, MLA stewards the American Archive of Public Broadcasting, an unprecedented initiative to preserve and make accessible historical content created by public media across the United States._**

Now, in collaboration with Olin College, the Archives are brought to life in their original form.

Our low-power broadcast system allows classic content to be broadcast to vintage, analog television sets, providing a warm, authentic means to consume visual media from past decades. *Archives Over the Air* serves to:

 * __Highlight the rich history of broadcast by institutions in the Boston area__ 
 * __Create an interactive, inter-generational touchpoint for families__
 * __Illustrate the charactor of the technology from yesterday and today__ 
 * __Create custom content that plays with the unique characteristics of the medium__ 
 
### Where We've Been

The Archives Over the Air installation is an interactive electronic exhibit, highlighting both content and physical interaction with vintage television sets. Visitors can view the broadcast content and interact by changing the channel or adjusting the antenna, replicating the original experience of watching television.

**Broadcast:** A single, central broadcast "tower," is capable of displaying digial media on up to six channels at once. A passive antenna provides a signal range of ~20 feet.

**Reception:** The signal can be received by any television set in range that is capable of receiving an analog signal, with no limitation on the number of sets. Currently, we have two television sets:
