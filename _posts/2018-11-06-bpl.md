**_The WGBH Media Library and Archives (MLA) ensures the long-term preservation and access to WGBHâ€™s vast archive of programming and original materials made available through the Open Vault. Olin College of Engineering identifies unique insitutional collaborations that enable new educational experiences that have lasting benefit for everyone._**

Working together, Olin Students have brought to life a corner of the WGBH archive in their original form.

We've designed and built a custom, FCC-approved, low-power broadcast system to transmit classic content to vintage, analog television sets over the air. This provides a novel, warm, authentic means to consume historic media from history. *Archives Over the Air* serves to:

 * __Highlight the rich history of broadcast by institutions in the Boston area__ 
 * __Create an interactive, inter-generational touchpoint for families__
 * __Illustrate the charactor of the technology from yesterday and today__ 
 * __Create custom content that plays with the unique characteristics of the medium__ 
 
### Where We've Been

In October 2018, we setup our *Archives Over the Air* installation at the WGBH Alumni Reunion event as a way of testing our technical setup. Footage from the event, with our setup in action, is shown below.

### Where We're Going

We're just at the beginning of this project! We would be thrilled to explore a deep collaboration with Boston Pulic Library. How can we co-create a new instance of *Archives Over the Air*? An engaging public exhibit that shares your holdings in new ways? 

### The Current Installation

*Archives Over the Air* installation is an interactive electronic exhibit, highlighting both content and physical interaction with vintage television sets. Visitors can view the broadcast content, change the channels to find new content, or adjust the antenna for better reception.  This is the full TV expreience.

**Broadcast:** A single, central broadcast "tower," is capable of displaying digial media on up to six channels at once. A passive antenna provides a signal range of ~20 feet.

**Reception:** The signal can be received by any television set in range that is capable of receiving an analog signal, with no limitation on the number of sets. Currently, we have 3 television sets: 

* __A 1970's Sony Trinitron, Color__ 
* __A 1980's Sears, Black & White__
* __A 1980's RCA hand-held, Color__
* __Create custom content that plays with the unique characteristics of the medium__
